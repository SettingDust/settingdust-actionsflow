# üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Build an Actionsflow workflow is a four-step process:

1. **Create a public Github repository by this [link](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow-workflow-default/generate).**

   A typical Actionsflow repository structure looks like this:

   ```sh
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows
   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ actionsflow.yml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rss.yml
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ webhook.yml
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
   ```

1. **Uncomment [`.github/workflows/actionsflow.yml`](/.github/workflows/actionsflow.yml) schedule event**

    ```yml
    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: "*/15 * * * *"
    ```
    > Note: To prevent abuse, by default, the schedule is commented, please modify the schedule time according to your own needs, the default is once every 15 minutes. Learn more about schedule event, please see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)

1. **Define your [workflow file](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/workflow/) at `workflows` directory**

   A typical workflow file `rss.yml` looks like this:

   ```yaml
   on:
     rss:
       url: https://hnrss.org/newest?points=300&count=3
   jobs:
     request:
       name: Make a HTTP Request
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Make a HTTP Request
           uses: actionsflow/axios@v1
           with:
             url: https://hookb.in/VGPzxoWbdjtE22bwznzE
             method: POST
             body: |
               {
                 "link":"${{ on.rss.outputs.link }}", 
                 "title": "${{ on.rss.outputs.title }}",
                 "content":"<<<${{ on.rss.outputs.contentSnippet }}>>>"
               }
   ```

1. **Commit and push your updates to Github**

Then, Actionsflow will run your workflows as you defined, you can view logs at your repository actions tab at [Github](https://github.com)

## Run Locally

You can run self-hosted Actionsflow manually or [by docker](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/self-hosted/#docker): 

## Prerequisites

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
1. Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`

### Start

Start Actionsflow locally:

```bash
npm run start
# Then, the cron job and webhook server will start running
# The webhook endpoint will be ran at http://localhost:3000/webhook/
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
# Then, the standard workflow files will be built at ./dist/workflows
```

### Clean

Actionsflow build will use cache for deduplicating the data, if you want to test your workflow with the same data, you may need to clean the cache by the following command:

```bash
# Clean the cache and dist folder.
npm run clean
```
